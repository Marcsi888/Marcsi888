# 👩‍💻 Hi There, I'm Mária Nyolcas 💫

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a **Python-loving  data scientist and junior tech consultant pursuing my dreams and goals in CS** with a passion for using **AI**, **machine learning**, and **web automation** to make a difference in the fields that matter, especially **neuroscience**, **medicine**, and **real estate**.

Currently, I'm working as a **Junior Tech Consultant**, helping design and develop a project management system with a brilliant team in the **real estate consulting space**. I also apply **web scraping and data analysis** to drive insights and efficiencies for property-related processes.

But my **true drive** lies in the intersection of **AI and medicine**, understanding the brain, decoding disease mechanisms, and contributing to healthcare innovation.

### My Expertise:
- **Neuroscience + NLP**: Check out my [NeuroQuery Project](link) – a full-stack AI app that classifies scientific papers, extracts study notes, and generates flashcards to support neuroscience education.
- **Web Scraping + Automation**: Building custom tools to collect and clean large-scale data from the web.
- **Data Science & Analysis**: Making sense of complex datasets with Python, pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
- **Web Development**: Front- and back-end experience with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React frameworks.

###  Current Projects:
- AI-driven migraine diagnosis model using patient and medical data.
- NLP-powered systems for analyzing and summarizing scientific literature.
- Deep learning models for medical imaging (e.g., X-ray classification).
- Project management tools for real estate tech consulting.

### 🎮 Bonus Fun: Pet Feeding Game:
Even though my passion lies in research and  serious, rigorous projects, sometimes I do like to experiment and do something more creative, like the following little, easy game:
Try my [Pet Feeding Game](https://github.com/Marcsi888/Pet_feeding_game): a quick, 1–2 hour project I made to play around with game design and JSON logic. It’s simple, quirky, with a pinch of fun and nice design.

### 💖 The Reason that Keeps Me Going:
I’m deeply curious about the **human brain** and passionate about using technology to improve lives. My long-term mission is to apply **AI and data science in medical research**, contribute to meaningful breakthroughs, and make science more accessible through well-designed tools.
