# 👩‍💻 Hi There, I'm Mária Nyolcas (aka Marcsi888) 💫

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a **Python-loving  data scientist and junior tech consultant pursuing my dreams and goals in CS** with a passion for using **AI**, **machine learning**, and **web automation** to make a difference in the fields that matter most — especially **neuroscience 🧠**, **medicine 🏥**, and **real estate 🏠**.

Currently, I'm working as a **Junior Tech Consultant**, helping design and develop a project management system with a brilliant team in the **real estate consulting space**. I also apply **web scraping and data analysis** to drive insights and efficiencies for property-related processes.

But my **true drive** lies in the intersection of **AI and medicine** — understanding the brain, decoding disease mechanisms, and contributing to healthcare innovation.

### 🎮 Bonus Fun: Pet Feeding Game:
Even though my passion lies in research and  serious, rigorous projects, sometimes I do like to experiment and do something more creative, like the following little, easy game:
Try my [Pet Feeding Game](https://github.com/Marcsi888/Pet_feeding_game) — a quick, 1–2 hour project I made to play around with game design and JSON logic. It’s simple, quirky, with a pinch of fun and nice design. 🐾

### 💖 The Reason that Keeps Me Going:
I’m deeply curious about the **human brain** and passionate about using technology to improve lives. My long-term mission is to apply **AI and data science in medical research**, contribute to meaningful breakthroughs, and make science more accessible through well-designed tools.
